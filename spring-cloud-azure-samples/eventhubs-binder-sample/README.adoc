= Spring Cloud Azure Stream Binder for Event Hub Code Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to use the Spring Cloud Stream binder for Azure Event Hub.
The sample app exposes a rest api to receive string message. Then message is sent through Azure
Event Hub to a `sink` which simply logs the message.

Running this sample will be charged by Azure. You can check the usage and bill at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/account/[this link].

== Connection string based usage

1. Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create[Azure Event Hubs]. Please note `Basic` tier is unsupported. 

2. Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/[Azure Storage] for checkpoint use.

3. Update link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]

+
....
# Fill event hub namespace connection string copied from portal
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.connection-string=[eventhub-namespace-connection-string]

# Fill checkpoint storage account name and accese key
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.checkpoint-storage-account=[checkpoint-storage-account]
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.checkpoint-access-key=[checkpoint-accesskey]
....

== Credential file based usage

1. Create Azure credential file. Please see https://github.com/Azure/azure-libraries-for-java/blob/master/AUTH.md[how
to create credential file]
+
....
$  az login
$  az account set --subscription <name or id>
$  az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth > my.azureauth
....
+
Make sure `my.azureauth` is encoded with UTF-8.

2. Put credential file under `src/main/resources/`.

3. Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create[Azure Event Hubs] and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/[Azure Storage]. Please note event hub `Basic` tier is unsupported. Or enable auto create
resources feature in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]:
+
....
spring.cloud.azure.auto-create-resources=true

# Default environment is GLOBAL. Provide your own if in another environment
# Example environment is China, GLOBAL
# spring.cloud.azure.environment=[environment]
# Example region is westUS, northchina
spring.cloud.azure.region=[region]
....

4. Update credential file based properties in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]
+
....
# Enter 'my.azureauth' here if following step 1 and 2
spring.cloud.azure.credential-file-path=[credential-file-path]
spring.cloud.azure.resource-group=[resource-group]

spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.namespace=[eventhub-namespace]
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.checkpoint-storage-account=[checkpoint-storage-account]
....

== MSI credential based usage

=== Overview

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/[MSI] (Managed Service Identity, aka Managed Identity) for Azure resources provides Azure services with an automatically managed identity in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis[Azure AD]. You can use this identity to authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication without having any credentials in your code.

Please note your application should run in VM (Virtual Machine) or App Services on Azure for support of MSI.

=== Steps

1. Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create[Azure Event Hubs]. Please note `Basic` tier is unsupported.

2. Create https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/[Azure Storage] for checkpoint use.

3. Create VM in Azure portal.
Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/quick-create-portal[Create a Windows virtual machine in the Azure portal] or https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal[Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal]. Choose any one according to your needs.

4. Create an user-assigned identity in Azure Portal.
Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-manage-ua-identity-portal#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity[Create an user-assigned managed identity].

5. Assign the user-assigned identity to the VM.
Please refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/qs-configure-portal-windows-vm#assign-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-to-an-existing-vm[Assign an user-assigned managed identity to an existing VM].

6. Add role assignment to event hub and storage account. You should add managed identity to the `Contributor` role for event hub, and add managed identity to the `Storage Account Key Operator Service Role` role for storage account.

For how to add role assignment to event hub, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-managed-service-identity[Managed identities for Azure resources with Event Hubs]. Adding role assignment to storage account is almost similar, you can set it in `Access Control (IAM)` page in Azure Portal of your storage account resource by imitating the steps of adding role assignment for event hub.
Role assignments are the way you control access to Azure resources. For different built-in role's descriptions, please see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles[Built-in role descriptions].

7. Update link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]
+
....
# Enable MSI for event hub and storage account
spring.cloud.azure.msi-enabled=true

# Fill subscription ID copied from portal
spring.cloud.azure.subscription-id=[subscription-id]

# Fill resource group name
spring.cloud.azure.resource-group=[resource-group]

# Fill checkpoint storage account name
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.checkpoint-storage-account=[checkpoint-storage-account]

# Fill event hub namespace
spring.cloud.azure.eventhub.namespace=[eventhub-namespace]
....

== How to run
1. Update stream binding related properties in link:src/main/resources/application.properties[application.properties]

+
....
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=[eventhub-name]
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.group=[consumer-group]
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=[eventhub-name]
....

2. Run the `mvn clean spring-boot:run` in the root of the code sample to get the app running.

3.  Send a POST request
+
....
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/messages?message=hello
....

4. Verify in your app's logs that a similar message was posted:
+
....
New message received: 'hello'
Message 'hello' successfully checkpointed
....

5. Delete the resources on http://ms.portal.azure.com/[Azure Portal] to avoid unexpected charges.
